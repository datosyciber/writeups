# Basic Pentesting 1

Target IP: 192.168.56.101 (vtcsec)

```bash
$ nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24

Nmap scan report for vtcsec (192.168.56.101)
Host is up (0.019s latency).

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.102
Host is up (0.013s latency).
```
Using a fast full port scan we can see we have 3 open TCP ports: 21, 22 and 80.

```
$ nmap -p- -Pn -T4 192.168.56.101

Launching an nmap scan with -sCV flags we can see that the following services are running in the target machine:

| Port | Version |
|------|---------|
| 21   | ProFTPD 1.3.3c |
| 22   | OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.2 |
| 80   | Apache httpd 2.4.18 |


### Port 80 

My first thought was to search info about ProFTPD, but before that, we'll see a bit about the web app hosted in the Apache server. After accessing to its content, we can see the text "It works! This is a default...". We are going to perform a directory enumeration in order to fin hidden information.

```
dirb http://192.168.56.101
```

We have found a new interesting directory named "secret", but after investigating a bit I have found anything interesting. I can also see a wp admin form, so let`s try the default credentials for WordPress. And surprisingly I have gained access. After investigating again I cant find anything interesting, so finally I move up to the next port.


### Port 21

Searching about this version ProFTPD 1.3.3c in searchsploit I can see there is a metasploit module to exploit a Backdoor Command Execution, so lets try it.

```
